# Artificial Neural Networks
In my first-time study of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) C++ was used for example code. I have played around with other computer languages, but I have not yet used python.  I was just going to do a little part on mathematics behind ANNs in my Code for Mathematics repository. Instead, I think it would be better just to do one on ANN and maybe do a larger one on AI. People have been thinking of neural networks sense 1943 and started trying to translate these networks onto computational systems.  the first Hebbian network was successfully implemented at MIT in 1954.  It was some time in the late 70’s I was studying AI stuff and read an article about Paul Werbos process of training artificial neural networks through backpropagation of errors. Most of it was above my head, but it got my attention.  This was quite a difference in my AI thinking like rule-based inferencing and knowledge-based systems. Lisp was my favorite language for Expert Systems. Currently, I think F#.  Even though I have read lots of other articles about ANN I never played with them until about the mid 90’s. You may have guess that if you knew your C++ history. I have not been doing much with ANN lately but have notices that a lot of applications are using them more and more these days. From character recognition to financial forecasting.
