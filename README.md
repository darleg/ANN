# Artifical Neural Network
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a computational model inspired by the way biological neural networks in the human brain work. It's a type of machine learning algorithm that is designed to recognize patterns and learn from data. ANNs are composed of layers of interconnected nodes, or "neurons," which process and transmit information.
