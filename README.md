# Artifical Neural Network
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a computational model inspired by the way biological neural networks in the human brain work. It's a type of machine learning algorithm that is designed to recognize patterns and learn from data. ANNs are composed of layers of interconnected nodes, or "neurons," which process and transmit information.

Structure of an ANN:

1. Neurons: The basic units that process information. Each neuron receives input, processes it, and passes the output to the next layer.
2. Layers:
    * Input Layer: The first layer that takes in the raw data.
    * Hidden Layers: Intermediate layers where the actual processing and feature extraction occur. ANNs can have multiple hidden layers (deep 
      learning models).
    * Output Layer: The final layer that produces the result or prediction.

3. Learning Process:
   * Forward Propagation: The input data is passed through the network layer by layer, and the output is generated.
   * Error Calculation: The difference between the predicted output and the actual output is calculated using a loss function.
   * Backward Propagation (Backpropagation): The error is propagated back through the network, and the weights of the connections are adjusted 
     to minimize the error. This process involves calculatin
