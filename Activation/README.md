Activation functions are key players in artificial neural networks (ANNs). They determine
whether a neuron should be activated or not by transforming the weighted sum of inputs
into an output signal for the next layer. This 
function introduces non-linearity into the model, enabling it to learn and 
model complex data patterns. Common examples include the sigmoid, hyperbolic 
tangent (tanh), and rectified linear unit (ReLU) functions.
