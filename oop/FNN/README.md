A Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) is one of the simplest forms of artificial neural networks. It consists of multiple layers of neurons, where each neuron is connected to every neuron in the subsequent layer. Here's a detailed description of FNNs:

A. Structure of a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)
1. Input Layer:
* Function: Receives the initial data and passes it to the next layer.
* Components: Each neuron in the input layer corresponds to a feature in the input data.
2. Hidden Layers:
* Function: Intermediate layers between the input and output layers that process input data 
  and extract relevant features.
* Components:
  * Neurons: Nodes that perform weighted sum of inputs and pass the result through an 
    activation function.
  * Weights: Parameters that are adjusted during training to minimize error.
  * Biases: Additional parameters added to the weighted sum before applying the activation 
    function to shift the activation function.
* Activation Functions: Functions like Sigmoid, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), Tanh, etc., 
  that introduce non-linearity into the network, allowing it to learn complex patterns.
3. Output Layer:
* Function: Produces the final result of the network, which could be a single value for 
  regression tasks or multiple values for classification tasks.
* Components: Each neuron in this layer represents a possible output.

B. Forward Propagation
The process where data moves through the network from the input layer to the output layer:

1. Input: The input features are fed into the network.
2. Weighted Sum and Activation: Each neuron in the hidden layer calculates the weighted sum 
   of its inputs, adds a bias, and applies an activation function.
3. Propagation: The activated values are passed to the next layer.
4. Output: This process continues until the output layer generates the final prediction.
