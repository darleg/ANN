A Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) is one of the simplest forms of artificial neural networks. It consists of multiple layers of neurons, where each neuron is connected to every neuron in the subsequent layer. Here's a detailed description of FNNs:

A. Structure of a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)
1. Input Layer:
-* Function: Receives the initial data and passes it to the next layer.
-* Components: Each neuron in the input layer corresponds to a feature in the input data.
2. Hidden Layers:

Function: Intermediate layers between the input and output layers that process input data and extract relevant features.

Components:

Neurons: Nodes that perform weighted sum of inputs and pass the result through an activation function.

Weights: Parameters that are adjusted during training to minimize error.

Biases: Additional parameters added to the weighted sum before applying the activation function to shift the activation function.

Activation Functions: Functions like Sigmoid, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), Tanh, etc., that introduce non-linearity into the network, allowing it to learn complex patterns.
