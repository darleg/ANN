A Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) is a simple type of artificial neural network where data moves in one direction: from input to output through multiple layers. Hereâ€™s a brief summary:

Key Points:
* Structure:
  * Input Layer: Receives initial data.
  * Hidden Layers: Intermediate layers that process input data. They apply weights and 
    activation functions to extract relevant features.
  * Output Layer: Produces the final result.
* Process:
  * Forward Propagation: Data passes through the network, layer by layer, transforming 
    inputs into outputs.
  * Backpropagation: Error is calculated and propagated backward to update weights, 
    minimizing the error in future predictions.
* Characteristics:
  * Activation Functions: Non-linear functions like Sigmoid or ReLU are used to introduce 
    non-linearity, enabling the network to learn complex patterns.
   * Learning: The network is trained using labeled data through iterative processes of 
     forward and backward propagation until the predictions are accurate.
* Advantages:
   * Simplicity: Easy to understand and implement.
   * Versatility: Can be used for various tasks such as classification, regression, and 
     function approximation.
* Challenges:
   * Scalability: Can become computationally expensive with large data sets.
   * Overfitting: Prone to overfitting if not regularized properly.
   * Lack of Memory: Cannot handle sequential data efficiently, unlike recurrent neural 
     networks (RNNs).
