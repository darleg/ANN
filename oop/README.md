Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) come in various types, each tailored for specific tasks and problem-solving approaches. Here are some of the key types:
  1.  Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN)
     * Description: The simplest type of ANN where connections between nodes do not form
       cycles.
     * Uses: Commonly used for tasks like image recognition and basic pattern recognition.
  3. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
     * Description: Specialized for processing grid-like data such as images, with 
       convolutional layers to detect features.
     * Uses: Widely used in computer vision tasks, including image and video recognition.

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

Description: Designed for sequential data, with connections that form directed cycles. They have memory of previous inputs.

Uses: Ideal for time-series data, natural language processing, and speech recognition.
