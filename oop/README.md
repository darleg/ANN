Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) come in various types, each tailored for specific tasks and problem-solving approaches. Here are some of the key types:
  1.  Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN)
      * Description: The simplest type of ANN where connections between nodes do not form
       cycles.
      * Uses: Commonly used for tasks like image recognition and basic pattern recognition.
  2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
     * Description: Specialized for processing grid-like data such as images, with 
       convolutional layers to detect features.
     * Uses: Widely used in computer vision tasks, including image and video recognition.
  3. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
     * Description: Designed for sequential data, with connections that form directed 
       cycles. 
       They have memory of previous inputs.
     * Uses: Ideal for time-series data, natural language processing, and speech 
       recognition.
   4. Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM)
      * Description: A type of RNN that can learn order dependence in sequence prediction 
        problems. They are capable of remembering information for long periods.
      * Uses: Suitable for tasks requiring long-term context understanding, like
      * language modeling and translation.
    5. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
      * Description: Consist of two neural networks (a generator and a discriminator) that 
        compete against each other to generate and improve realistic data samples.
      * Uses: Commonly used in image generation, style transfer, and creating realistic 
        synthetic data.
